# Tello-Drone
In this repository you will find all the codes I used to program and control my TELLO DRONE. This drone is very simple to operate and program. Using "djitellopy" and "pygame" I was able to write some code to control it usign my keypad. You can also implement computer vision to it to detect and follow any object you want.
